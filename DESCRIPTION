Description: An Arsenal of R functions for large-scale statistical summaries,
  which are streamlined to work within the latest reporting tools in R and
  RStudio and which use formulas and versatile summary statistics for summary
  tables and models. The primary functions include tableby, a Table-1-like
  summary of multiple variable types "by" the levels of a categorical
  variable; modelsum, which performs simple model fits on the same endpoint
  for many variables (univariate or adjusted for standard covariates);
  and freqlist, a powerful frequency table across many categorical variables.
