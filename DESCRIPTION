Description: An Arsenal of 'R' functions for large-scale statistical summaries,
  which are streamlined to work within the latest reporting tools in 'R' and
  'RStudio' and which use formulas and versatile summary statistics for summary
  tables and models. The primary functions include tableby(), a Table-1-like
  summary of multiple variable types 'by' the levels of a categorical
  variable; modelsum(), which performs simple model fits on the same endpoint
  for many variables (univariate or adjusted for standard covariates);
  and freqlist(), a powerful frequency table across many categorical variables.
